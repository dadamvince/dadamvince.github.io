In this initiative, I am part of a small team supervised by Prof Nicola Viegi, Head of the Department of Economics and South African Reserve Bank Chair in Monetary Economics at the University of Pretoria. The South African Modelling Network (SAMNet) goal is to stay in touch with developments in the macroeconomic scene at the global level. The idea is to pool resources in order to connect national policy and academic research with global trends.

SAMNet is founded on three main pillars:

- Model development: Promote the development of new modelling and forecasting tools to enrich the toolbox available to policy makers.
- Code sharing: Facilitate the sharing of model codes and provide a platform for economists interested in economic modelling to engage with each other on model development techniques.
- Training: Promote training opportunities with a focus on forecasting and modelling to set the standards on the use of models in policy analysis.

SAMNet is affiliate with Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) and we frequently organize workshops.

<p align="justify"> I am currently a Postodoctoral Fellow at the University of Pretoria, sponsored by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Chair in Monetary Economics. I am also a Policy Associate with Economic Research Southern Africa ([ERSA](https://econrsa.org)) where I am part of a small team running the South African Modelling Network ([SAMNet](https://samnet.org.za/)). The [SAMNet page](/samnet/) on this website will provide you with further information.</p>

<p align="justify"> My field of research focuses on the modelling of the labour market at a macroeconomic level and the implications it may have for monetary policy conduct. At the moment, I am focusing on investigating labour market flows between public and private sector jobs in an economy battling with a significant skill gap and an exceptionally high level of unemployment.</p>

<p align="justify"> Another area I am exploring at the moment is the investigation of the potential of Mobile Money as a digital currency in a world dominated by cryptocurrencies. This links with the current debate with on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).</p>

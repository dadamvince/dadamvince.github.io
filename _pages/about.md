I am currently a Postodoctoral Fellow at the University of Pretoria, sponsored by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Chair in Monetary Economics. I am also a Policy Associate with Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) where I am part of a team running the South African Modelling Network (SAMNet). Follow www.smanet.org.za to find out more.

My field of research focuses on the modelling of the labour market at a macroeconomic level and the implications it may have for monetary policy conduct. At the moment, I am focusing on investigating labour market flows between public and private sector jobs in an economy battling with significant skill gap and an exceptionally high level of unemployment.

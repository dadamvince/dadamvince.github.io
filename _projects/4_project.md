<p align="justify"> We study the evolution of mobile money in Africa since its implementation in the early 2000s, and we investigate its potential to become a
digital currency. Meetings have been planned with a Mobile Financial Services executive from the
mobile operator Orange who has agreed to share the significantly rich data we intend to analyse on
multiple fronts. That includes - but not limited to - a panel analysis and a geospatial
analysis that will give us a birdâ€™s eye view of the evolution of the transactions using mobile money
through time.</p>

<p align="justify"> This project is part of an international network of research with the goal of investigating the digital currencies in central banks. The Laboratoire d'Economie Rouen Normandie</p> ([LERN](https://lern.univ-rouen.fr/le-laboratoire-0)) of the University of Rouen leads this general project.

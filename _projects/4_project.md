<p align="justify"> We study the evolution of Mobile Money on the African continent since its implementation in the early 2000s pioneered through M-Pesa in Kenya, and we investigate its potential to become a digital currency. This is an interesting area to explore for the conduct of monetary policy in a world dominated by cryptocurrencies and the debates surrounding Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).</p> Aggregate data obtained from [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/mobilemoneymetrics/#) allowed us to draw rough results to form our priors. <p align="justify"> We plan to partner with the mobile operator Orange to obtain more disaggregated and significantly rich data which we intend to analyse on multiple fronts. That includes - but not limited to - a panel analysis and a geospatial analysis that will give us a birdâ€™s eye view of the evolution of the transactions using Mobile Money through time.</p>

This project is part of an international network of researchers with the goal of investigating the digital currencies in central banks. The Laboratoire d'Economie Rouen Normandie ([LERN](https://lern.univ-rouen.fr/le-laboratoire-0)) of the University of Rouen leads the initiative.

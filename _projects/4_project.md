We study the evolution of mobile money in
Africa since its implementation in the early 2000s, and we investigate its potential to become a
digital currency. Meetings have been planned with a Mobile Financial Services executive from the
mobile operator Orange who has agreed to share the significantly rich data we intend to analyse on
multiple fronts. That includes - but not limited to - a panel analysis and a geospatial
analysis that will give us a birdâ€™s eye view of the evolution of the transactions using mobile money
through time.
This project is part of an international network of research with the goal of investigating the digital currencies in central banks.

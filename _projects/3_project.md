This estimation approach focuses particularly
on the COVID-19 era using various measures of economic activity to better capture an estimate of
the output gap. We use both the Oxford Stringency and Google Mobility indices to better estimate
potential GDP in order to derive a more accurate definition of the output gap which in turns leads
to a more convincing estimate for the natural rate of interest. This project is in progress with Prof Mehmet
Balcilar form the Eastern Mediterranean University in Cyprus.

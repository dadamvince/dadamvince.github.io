  title={Estimating a New Keynesian wage Phillips curve for South Africa},
  author={Dadam, V. and Viegi, N.},
  abstract={This paper estimates a New Keynesian wage Phillips curve for South Africa to
determine the responsiviness of nominal wages to employment conditions. The
estimation is based on a New Keynesian model with staggered nominal wages
setting and where all variations in hired labour input is taking place at
the extensive margin. First we estimate the model using aggregate data from
1971 to 2013. The aggreagate estimations show that private sector nominal
wages are not responsive to employment conditions, while they show a certain
sensitivity to inflation and quite a good correlation with inflation
expectations. The relationship between private sector nominal wage inflation
and employment is clearly weak for the whole sample, and it becomes
insignificant at the end of the sample, indicating an increase of wage
rigidities in the post-apartheid South Africa. On the other hand the
relationship between nominal wage inflation and price inflation is quite
strong and robust for the whole sample but it becomes quantitatively weak
for the inflation targeting period. In this period Trade Union inflation
expectations are instead strongly correlated with nominal wage inflation.

In the second part of the paper we look at the relationship between nominal
wage, productivity and the reservation wage, using a panel of nine
industrial sectors over the period 1970- 2013 The findings confirms that
nominal wages inflation have consistently outpaced the growth in
productivity, even after correcting for inflation, and that employment
conditions had little effect on wage dynamics. We also test for the
possibility that the dynamic of wages is anchored by an underlined
reservation wage to investigate the presence of an error correction in a
wage equation for South Africa. The results show that labour productivity
has a direct effect on wages and the reservation wage.

The overall picture that comes out from the analysis is of a wage formation
mechanism that is very insensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions.},
